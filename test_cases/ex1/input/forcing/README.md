This is a test case for version of Sac-SMA that uses an external daily varying PET value supplied in the model forcing. Operational NWS 
Sac-SMA models are often run with a mean monthly climatological PET cycle value rather than a daily-varying input.

This test case was used in developing the Sac-SMA and Snow17 routines togther, but is not a useful choice for running Sac-SMA in isolation, as 
the test basin (SF Flathead River, MT, inflows to Hungry Horse Reservoir) experiences snow, which is not simulated by Sac-SMA alone.  The 
standalone test case will soon be replaced, but for now it can be used to demonstrate that the model code runs.
